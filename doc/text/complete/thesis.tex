\section*{Abstract}

Modern analysis instruments in life sciences produce data on an ever-larger scale. While this allows more comprehensive insight into biological mechanisms, it also requires computational methods able to process the data appropriately. Currently, the method of choice for analyzing a proteome, the entirety of proteins in a cell or an organism, is mass spectrometry, which produces spectra containing information corresponding to the peptide's amino acid sequence. An important step in matching every spectrum to the peptide they originate from, is the well-established Percolator algorithm. It combines every information about the spectrum, peptide and scores for the similarity of peptide-spectrum-match, to achieve best possible separation between correct and incorrect matches.\\
In this thesis, the algorithm was transferred from C++ into the python programming language. This implementation increases the flexibility and extends the range of potential applications by enabling the use of machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, which can be utilized to adapt the algorithm more easily to the special demands of one’s experiment. As such, we present Pycolator, an adaptation of Percolator to the characteristics of peptides cross-linked onto (ribo-)~nucleotides, for which the original algorithm often does not provide optimal results. Pycolator finds $1\%$ more cross-linked peptides on the tested dataset and employs techniques to reduce variation. The analysis of such proteins promises to yield insight about the interaction between peptides and DNA or RNA, possibly providing a more comprehensive view on the interactions driving biological systems.
